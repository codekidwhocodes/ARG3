    A Russian man with the name of Nikítin has been killed in the HPC Laboratory. Some critics do not like this, but the officials proclaimed it's necessary. Ivan Morozov, the leader of entire thing, stated "our наука о прогрессе человека laboratory needs advances, not detrimental failures. Nikítin was on his way to escape and to contact users of a certain website created by an unknown person. We cannot let that happen, or our experiments would come to light— I mean our things will be leaked. We can't let that happen." We kπow that Morozov is hiding something, but we don't know what. This news article has been concluded.

    <h1 class = "news">New Chemical Found in Mines Can Help With Hair Loss</h1>
    <p class = "date">Thursday, June 4th, 1998</p>
    <p class = "news">
    A chemical, known as Xenopsium Chloride (AvCl), was found deep underground, 50,000 ft below sea level. Miners in the Mordova Mine of Mineland discovered an unrecognizable rock with some sort of metalic ore. After scientists dug deeper into the concentrated rock, they ran some tests and realized that it was the one hundred fourty-ninth element, xenopsium, with the element chlorine. This element is slightly radioactive and is an unstable isotope in some conditions. AvCl attracts certain human subjects l°cated in the HPC laboratory, and it has been chaos for them. The element has been even turned into a safe drug for patients with cancer, and can also be used to prevent hair loss. It also treats autism, and is a good replacement for lobo†omy. "We are proud of our invention," said therapist and scientist Irina Astorov. "This invention can change life forever!"

    <h1 class = "news">"Child Labor is Actually Ethical," says Nikolai Alexandrov</h1>
    <p class = "date">Friday, June 5th, 1998</p>
    <p class = "news">
    A long time ago, fifty years ago, in 1948, our first leader, Korikius Kovichov, made his first proposition. It was to prevent child labor. Although his çomrade, the Governor of Illuminati, disagreed with Kovichov, he decided to do it anyway. The current vodkæater of this nation, Nikolai Alexandrov, said in his latest speech, "Child labor is actually ethical. With children, we can accomplish so much more. As you can see, children have always been attached to labor, since the invention of mining gαmes and other things. It's only fair that we force them to do more than just games." His next proposition will be to start child labor again. Now, we are asking people if they want to ship their children to the Atlantic in Mineland to work in the mines.
